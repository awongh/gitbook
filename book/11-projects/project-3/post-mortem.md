Congratulations on completing your first full-stack team project. This will likely be the most advanced project you've built, and it will also be the first time you've had to work so closely with other developers. We suspect you've learnt a lot and we want to hear about it.

So your challenge now is to work as a team once more and write a post-mortem for your project. We recommend that you host this on Medium but you can also do this as a Markdown file in your Github Repo. Do include images to make the post-mortem more engaging.

Once complete add the link to your project README.md and also share it on Slack for your instructional team and classmates to read.

## Suggested Structure
Try to answer some of the following questions, but feel free to dive deeper with your own reflections.
- What is the project about and how does it work?
- What was your development workflow?
- What was the UX design process?
- What went well on the project?
- What didn't go so well on the project?
- What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?
- What was working in a team like?
- What were the strengths of your team?
- What were the weaknesses of your team and how did these manifest?
- If you could start the project over, what would you do differently?
