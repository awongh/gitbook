# Project Guidelines

## Getting Started & Submission
* To start, fork the starter-repository mentioned in your course Github Repo.
* Commit your code to your forked repo and insure you update the README.md file - remember to include a link to your hosted application, e.g. Github Pages or Heroku.
* To submit, make a pull-request to the Project Repo, this will notify the instructional team that your Repo is up-to date.

## Presentations
On the final day of each project week, each student will be required to present their work to the group. Guidelines are given below, please follow.

### Logistics
* **Presentations are 10 mins**: 5 minutes formal presentation and 5 minutes feedback/Q&A. Group presentations will have 15 minutes for formal presentation.
* Order of presentations will be written on the board at at 9am - the first presentation will **begin promptly at 9:30am**.
* Questions should be saved until after the presentation.

### Feedback
* The student/group before the current presenter should give one bit of _GLOW feedback_ (i.e. One great thing about the project)
* The student/group after the current presenter should give one bit of _GROW feedback_ (i.e. A possible improvement to the project)

### Presentation Components
You should include the following in your presentation:

#### Project Workflow
Walk us through how you approached the problem and what tools you used in development.
**You will be evaluated based upon your use of the taught workflow: user stories, wireframes, task tracking (e.g. Trello) and Source Control using git.**

#### Solution
Live Demonstration of your project, showing us how it works.
**You will be evaluated on meeting the technical requirements of the project as defined in the brief, as well as creativity.**

#### Code Walkthrough
You will walk through your code and describe the logical flow of your project.
**You will be evaluated based on the quality of code and your ability to describe/defend the approach you have taken.**
