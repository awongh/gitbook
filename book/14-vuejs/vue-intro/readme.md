# Introduction to Vue

* To get a rough idea of what Vue (pronounced “view”) does, think about it as the ‘V’ in an MV* pattern. If you’d like to compare it to something else, it’s probably closest to React but with a far lower barrier of entry.

##### React, Angular or Vue?

* This is not a debate but Vue was created by taking some of the better parts of Angular and React and combining them together into one small package. Not the perfect tool, but quite an useful tool
