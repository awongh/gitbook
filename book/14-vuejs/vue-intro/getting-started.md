# Getting Started


> _Disclaimer on Offical Vue Guide:_  
> The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

All contents on this page can be found on the official Vue.js guide [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)!  

The easiest way to set up a VueJS application is to use a direct `<script>` include in the `<head>` of your html file. By including this script, all Vue.js features can be accessed in your html page.  
```
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
  ...
</head>
```
